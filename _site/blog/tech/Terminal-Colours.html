    <p>I have decided to clean up my vim colorschemes. I have been using ir_black for sometime but it does not look the same as others who use it. I think I was forcing it into 256 or 16 color mode.</p>

<p>Some vim command line on some terminals looked awful and I had to switch to another colorscheme just so I could see the text.</p>

<p>I have decided to pick an 8,16,256 and full color scheme and load them automatically, rather than trying to find a colorscheme which degraded gracefully, they just never seemed to do it that well.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/tag/xterm-256color/">sanctum.geek.nz</a> I discovered the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tput colors</code> command. Vims <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;t_Co</code> will reflect this value.  But it only reflects the calling terminals capabilities, so calling gvim or mvim from an 8 bit color terminal your &amp;t_Co will still be 8.</p>

<p>After some trouble getting the 8 colour scheme to work posted a question on <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/604589/vim-non-gui-background-will-not-go-white">superuser</a>.</p>

<p>The main solution seems to be to append your TERM envar with -256color to force 256 Colour detection.  I was originally hesitant to blindly apply 256 color to any system I may be working on, but I think it would be rare to come across a terminal that does not support 256 colors these days. This would also have to be a system/network where I have already set-up my dotfiles.</p>

<p>Adding -256color to term makes tput return 256 and makes vim t_Co 256 as well.
For csh:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>setenv TERM $TERM-256color
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For a bit more protection you should stop multiple -256colors being appended i.e. stop xterm-256color-256color if called from bash with 256color extension already applied.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>if ($TERM =~ *256color*) then
  #Already 256color
else
  setenv TERM $TERM-256color
endif
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For Bash:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>if [[ "$TERM" != *256color* ]]
then
  export TERM=$TERM-256color
fi
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using a <a href="https://github.com/wardi/xterm_colour_chart">python script</a> you can display color charts in the terminal. It should be clear if 256 colors is not working, you would only see 16 colour blocks.</p>

<p><a href="http://flickr.com/gp/morgan_prior/45kh8P"> <img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5542/9272025578_7a86fc474c_n.jpg" alt="colour block" /> </a></p>

<p>After all of this instead of getting my vim colour schemes to degrade gracefully I force everything into 256 colours mode. Which I think is actually ok and I get to use better colour schemes all/more of the time.</p>
