While enjoy photography I am not that interested in portrait, fashion or lifestyle photography but for some reason I decided to watch the [Jeremy Cowart][] classes on [Kelby Training][]. The two classes I watched were the [On Location Part 1][] and [On Location Part 2][]. 

I found these on location classes really interesting, Scott Kelby shadowing Jeremy and asking questions while he was shooting. Seeing this insight into how people approach a shoot and what they look for to make the picture.  Jeremy has a great ability to find interesting backgrounds for portraits. Shoots in mostly manual and using simple lighting setups starting with natural light and bringing in a reflector and or strobe when required.


[Jeremy Cowart][] Also has a 4 hour DVD out covering 7 shoots, [LIFEFINDER][]. I have not watched this yet but based on what I have seen from Jeremy it is going to be really good, expect it to cost around $150.
