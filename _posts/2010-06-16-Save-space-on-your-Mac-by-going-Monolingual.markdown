I have just looked through [this list][all] of 10 free mac apps I have used most of them in the past but have never come across [monolingual][mono] before. It removes all the extra languages that come as part of OS X and the translations from within most application. I left English, English UK, Scottish, Latin and Greek and saved about 1.4GB. it reported 1.8GB but I think this was a bit optimistic but I did not write down the free space before hand, the removed sections do not go to the trash can so the space starts to free up immediately.

Use [Monolingual][mono] to save space.
