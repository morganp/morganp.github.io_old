Matlab always use to open text files in tabs in the same editor window. When switching to 2014a documents started opening as separate windows.

It seems to have been a problem which [occasionally shows up for others](http://www.mathworks.co.uk/matlabcentral/answers/9587-editor-multiple-tabs)

Current solution is to dock the editor (ctrl-shift-D) , open multiple files (2 or more) then undock the group (ctrl-shift-U).
