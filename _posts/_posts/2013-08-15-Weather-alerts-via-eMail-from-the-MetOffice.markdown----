In the UK you can now get regional weather alerts from the 
[Met Office](https://service.govdelivery.com/service/multi_subscribe.html?code=UKMETOFFICE&origin=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk).

Unfortunately it does not break it down any further, all I really wanted was a frost alert to look after my plants, but now I will know about any hazards weather 24 hours in advance.

AdamFoster seems to have set up a free service [FrostAlert](http://frostalertemail.com/).
