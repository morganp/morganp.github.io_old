A [recent article by sef][post] about how to judge an engineering companies respect engineers and the strength of the engineering culture, used the size of the monitors as a litmus test. This is actually one of the things I pay attention to when getting shown around a potential new company. Do they invest in hardware that lets you work more efficiently.

I ended up moving from a company that gave me 2 17" monitors to one that supplied 2 24" monitors. Many other things were taken into consideration but it was a very good indicator of how well the engineering staff were treated.
