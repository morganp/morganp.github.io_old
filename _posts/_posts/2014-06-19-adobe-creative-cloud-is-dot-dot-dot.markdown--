Inconsistent, annoying, **cheap**?

<!-- more -->

My main bugbear with the creative cloud application is the way it updates applications.
Photoshop CC and Lightroom are handled differently.

Photoshop switches from installed to update. Which is great it will pull in the update on my command.

Lightroom switches from Installed to **Try**.

Not only that but I have now have 2 version of Photoshop CC and CC (2014) ready
for updates, one of which has not already been installed.

SO I have 2 applications with updates ready, one wants an update the other refuses
to acknowledge it has been installed and wants a new install. A new program,
Photoshop CC (2014), which only requires an update.
