The first tree I purchased was this Yoshino Cherry: Prunus x yedoensis Ivensii for Â£40 from [Smeaton Nursery](http://www.smeatonnurserygardens.co.uk/).

For the first year it was plagued with cherry black fly. Which was [my first question on Gardening SE](http://gardening.stackexchange.com/q/7664/2381).
