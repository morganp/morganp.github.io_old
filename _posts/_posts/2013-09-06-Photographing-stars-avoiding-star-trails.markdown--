While not attempted getting good images of the milkyway yet every so often I see some good examples and do a little bit more research.

This thread on [Canon Rumours](http://www.canonrumors.com/forum/index.php?topic=16310.msg300095#msg300095) pointed me towards the '600 Rule'.

As a guide to avoid star trails 600/focal length gives the maximum exposure in seconds avoiding star trails.

    600/24mm => 25 Second exposure

[Rule of 600 discussed on photo stackexchange](http://photo.stackexchange.com/q/30263/5572)
