Joe Cornish has been a great influence on my photography, he traditionally works with a large format field camera and is well renowned for his colour works of the british landscape. Trying to find his books in order can be tricky, so I have created this list.

I also own many of the books above and would especially recommend [First Light][first] and the [With Landscape in Mind DVD][mind], both offer a lot of insight into how he approaches taking photographs and are filled with great images.

Joe Cornish has contributed toward many other books especially the [light and land series][light].
