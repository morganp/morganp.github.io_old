High quality printers actually have lower resolutions than you would expect. [Nothlight Images][nli] have a good article on it [here][nli]. The gist of it is that maximum image ppi (pixels per inch) at most needs to be 286 if viewing from 2 feet.

A 10MP image (2592 x 3888) from my canon 400D can be printed  8" x 12" at 305 ppi. 
I would also like to note that I have printed a 10MP image WITHOUT up-sampling at 30" x 40" that is 97ppi, If i get about 6 inches from the print, edges start to pixelate, so if I had up-sampled or had I high resolution image then it might have looked a little sharper. but then an image which is over 1/2 Sq meter is not meant to be viewed that closely and I would not expect them them to be super sharp when analysing with a loupe.

Round up of a few large formats for printing:

| Size     | [Trumps][] | [PhotoBox][] | [SnapFish][] |
|:-----:|:------:|:-------:|:--------:|
|12 x 8  | £2.49     | £6.59     | £1.20        |
|16 x 12| £5.49     | £6.49     | £5.99        |
|20 x 16| £9.99     | £10.79   | -               |
|24 x 18| £12.99   |  -           | -               |
|30 x 20| £17.99   | £17.49   | £14.99      |
|40 x 30| -            | £24.99   | £19.99      |

Although better deals are available, [PhotoBox][] often run 2for1 offers and [Trumps][] and other professional printers offer pro packages, which require you to sort out your files before hand. Pro Packages are a fixed price (not including VAT) for 1-10 prints and 11-20 prints etc, i.e. you pay the same amount for 1 print as you do 10. That could be 1 image 10 times or 10 images once. 

For 20 24x18 prints you would pay £128.00 + VAT.
