I have always had trouble getting seeds to germinate, therefore I have purchased a [propagator](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000YA43HC?tag=morgue-21&camp=2902&creative=19466&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=B000YA43HC&adid=18Q38Q8QS33XBPP04WNR&) to help. Ideally I would have a thermostatically controlled unit, but they tend to be a bit more expensive, and non-looked like they wood fit nicely on a windowsill. 


Garland Super7, should raise soil temperature by 8 degrees but fluctions of indoor temp will be passed on:

Hopefully I will have some better luck in the future.
