When `.` just will not do (repeats last action) because you need to capture  a movement as well, macros are quick to create and use.

    q<number><actions>q

Replay macro

    @<number> 

Replay macro 10 times

    10@<number>

Example
Yank and put line, then repeat 10 times.

    q1 yyP q

    10@1
