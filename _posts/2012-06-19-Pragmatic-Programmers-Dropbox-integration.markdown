After deciding to try out epub on the kindle, as I noticed people are listing epub as an apple format. I thought it was an open version of mobi, for other ebook readers, and since the iPad is good with pdfs did not really think apple would have been to interested.

I noticed in my [Dropbox][] when I first paired it with my [PragProg][] I had only selected pdfs, as I planned to send mobi to my kindle and would only need pdfs portable. Since then I have changed that decision and get all formats delivered to [Dropbox][]. So I thought I would go through my old titles download the missing files and uploaded them to Dropbox. Where they would magically appear on my iPad.

[PragProg][] have done an amazing job with their [Drobbox][] integration, after selecting "Download eBook" just under the format download links is a "Send to Dropbox" which send all the currently selected formats. Brilliant no need for me to download from [PragProg][] and re-upload to [Dropbox][] just to get them onto the ipad, [PragProg] do all the heavy lifting making it really easy to get their content on to the iPad.
