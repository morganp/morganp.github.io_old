A cheap (~Â£15) four tier [Botanico growhouse](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00IA1KI7G?tag=morgue-21&camp=2902&creative=19466&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=B00IA1KI7G&adid=117VNH8ZGZJVTEV9GJFD&), with my current selection of potted herbs.

Over the course of the summer I think the temperatures inside actually became too hot for the plants during midday. I think best to use as an early start on the season and to extend the season for small plants.

NB: The growhouse did not make it through the winter storms.
